## SQL codes:

-- Q1. Write a code to check NULL values
SELECT *
FROM covid
WHERE province IS NULL
	OR country IS NULL
	OR date IS NULL
	OR confirmed IS NULL
	OR death IS NULL
	OR recovered IS NULL

-- Q2. If NULL values are present, update them with zeros for all columns. 
UPDATE covid
SET
	confirmed = COALESCE(confirmed,0),
	death = COALESCE(death,0),
	recovered = COALESCE(recovered,0)

-- Q3. check total number of rows
SELECT 
COUNT(confirmed) AS n_row
FROM covid

-- Q4. Check what is start_date and end_date
SELECT 
	MIN(date) AS start_date,
	MAX(date) AS end_date
FROM covid

-- Q5. Number of month present in dataset
SELECT 
	DISTINCT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date) AS year,
	EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date) AS month
FROM covid
ORDER BY year, month 

-- Q6. Find monthly average for confirmed, deaths, recovered
SELECT 
	DISTINCT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date) AS month,
	ROUND(AVG(confirmed),1) AS avg_confirmed,
	ROUND(AVG(death),1) AS avg_deaths,
	ROUND(AVG(recovered),1) AS avg_recovered
FROM covid
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month ASC

-- Q7. Find most frequent value for confirmed, deaths, recovered each month: Please find solution to this task in separate file

-- Q8. Find minimum values for confirmed, deaths, recovered per year
SELECT 
	DISTINCT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date) AS year,
	MIN(confirmed) AS min_confirmed,
	MIN(death) AS min_deaths,
	MIN(recovered) AS min_recovered
FROM covid
GROUP BY year
ORDER BY year

-- Q9. Find maximum values of confirmed, deaths, recovered per year
SELECT 
	DISTINCT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date) AS year,
	MAX(confirmed) AS max_confirmed,
	MAX(death) AS max_deaths,
	MAX(recovered) AS max_recovered
FROM covid
GROUP BY year
ORDER BY year

-- Q10. The total number of case of confirmed, deaths, recovered each month
SELECT 
	DISTINCT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date) AS month,
	SUM(confirmed) AS total_confirmed,
	SUM(death) AS total_deaths,
	SUM(recovered) AS total_recovered
FROM covid
GROUP BY month

-- Q11. Check how corona virus spread out with respect to confirmed case
--      (Eg.: total confirmed cases, their average, variance & STDEV )

-- Q12. Check how corona virus spread out with respect to death case per month
--      (Eg.: total confirmed cases, their average, variance & STDEV )

-- Q13. Check how corona virus spread out with respect to recovered case
--      (Eg.: total confirmed cases, their average, variance & STDEV )

-- Q14. Find Country having highest number of the Confirmed case
SELECT 
	country,
	SUM(confirmed) AS total_confirmed
FROM covid
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY total_confirmed DESC
LIMIT 1

-- Q15. Find Country having lowest number of the death case
SELECT 
	country,
	SUM(confirmed) AS total_confirmed
FROM covid
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY total_confirmed ASC
LIMIT 1

-- Q16. Find top 5 countries having highest recovered case
SELECT 
	country,
	SUM(recovered) AS total_recovered
FROM covid
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY total_recovered DESC
LIMIT 5
