SELECT *
FROM covid
WHERE province IS NULL
	OR country IS NULL
	OR date IS NULL
	OR confirmed IS NULL
	OR death IS NULL
	OR recovered IS NULL

-- Q2. If NULL values are present, update them with zeros for all columns. 
UPDATE covid
SET
	confirmed = COALESCE(confirmed,0),
	death = COALESCE(death,0),

	MIN(date) AS start_date,
	MAX(date) AS end_date
FROM covid

-- Q5. Number of month present in dataset
SELECT 
	DISTINCT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date) AS year,

	ROUND(STDDEV(confirmed),2) AS stddev_confirmed
FROM covid
GROUP BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date), EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date)
ORDER BY year, month

-- Q12. Check how corona virus spread out with respect to death case per month (Eg.: total confirmed cases, their average, variance & STDEV )
SELECT 
	CONCAT(EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date), '-', EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date)) AS year_month,
	SUM(death) AS total_deaths,
	ROUND(AVG(death),2) AS avg_deaths,
	ROUND(VAR_SAMP(death),2) AS var_deaths,
